# UNIACE SEO Marketing Campaign Analysis - August 2021

## Project Overview

In August 2021, UNIACE, an online course provider, launched the "Young Talent" SEO Marketing campaign. The campaign aimed to boost visibility and attract users to the company's website by publishing posts in five different groups. Four of these groups received the post on the night of August 12th and at noon on August 13th. The marketing department has requested an in-depth analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of this campaign.

### Project Objectives

As a Data Analyst at UNIACE, your primary objectives for this project are as follows:

1. **Impact of SEO Marketing on Website**: Determine the point at which the marketing efforts reached saturation, i.e., when additional efforts yielded diminishing returns.
2. **Content Optimization**: Identify the most popular content types and find the most attractive keywords that drove user engagement.
3. **Content Creation**: Recommend strategies for regularly publishing high-quality, relevant content that addresses user intent and incorporates target keywords.
4. **Traffic Analysis**: Analyze website traffic, user behavior, and conversion rates to identify areas of over-leveraging and opportunities for improvement.

### Data Source

The analysis is based on log data captured from the UNIACE website, which includes various types of user interactions, system events, and other relevant information as users navigate the site.

### Measured Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of the SEO marketing campaign, the following metrics will be developed and analyzed:

- **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: The ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement.
- **Churn Rate**: The percentage of users who stop interacting with the website or unsubscribe from a service during a given period.

### Tools Used

- **SQL**: For querying and extracting data from the database.
- **Power BI**: For visualizing data, building dashboards, and conducting in-depth traffic and behavior analysis.

## Project Deliverables

- **Content Optimization Insights**: A summary of the most popular content types and keywords, along with recommendations for content creation.
- **Traffic Analysis Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard developed in Power BI to visualize key traffic metrics, user behavior, and conversion rates.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Actionable recommendations for content creation and SEO strategy improvement based on the analysis.

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis, ensure that your environment is set up with SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization. Access to the website log data is required for the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project will provide UNIACE with valuable insights into the effectiveness of the "Young Talent" SEO Marketing campaign, guiding future marketing strategies and content creation efforts.
